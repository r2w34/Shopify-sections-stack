## üîê Important Notes

### About `write_themes` Scope

Your app uses the `write_themes` scope to add sections to themes. This requires **special approval from Shopify**.

**To apply for approval:**
1. Go to: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZTB1vxFC5d1-GPdqYunWRGUoDcOheHQzfK2RoEFEHrknt5g/viewform
2. Fill out the form explaining your app adds theme sections
3. Wait 1-2 weeks for approval
4. **Note:** App will work in development mode without approval

---

## üÜò If Still Not Working

### Check Application Logs:
```bash
ssh root@72.60.99.154
cd /var/www/sectionit
docker logs sectionstack-app --tail=100
```

### Look for:
- Authentication errors
- 404 errors with the URL path
- HMAC validation errors

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: "No route matches URL"**
- **Cause:** Shopify App URL points to wrong path
- **Fix:** Make sure App URL is `https://sectionit.indigenservices.com` (no /app suffix)

**Issue 2: "HMAC validation failed"**
- **Cause:** API Secret doesn't match
- **Fix:** Verify API Secret in Partner Dashboard matches .env.production

**Issue 3: "Invalid shop domain"**
- **Cause:** App not installed on the store
- **Fix:** Install app from Shopify Admin ‚Üí Apps
