## 🚨 Critical Bug Details

### The Problem
```typescript
// Current Purchase model (BROKEN):
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  sectionId: ObjectId,
  purchasedAt: Date
}

// But webhook tries to use:
purchase.chargeId = "...";  // ❌ Doesn't exist!
purchase.status = "...";     // ❌ Doesn't exist!
```

### The Fix
```typescript
// Add these fields:
chargeId: { type: String, required: true },
status: { type: String, default: "pending" },
```

### Why It Matters
Without these fields:
- Billing API works ✅
- Webhook arrives ✅
- Save to database ❌ FAILS
- Merchant doesn't get section ❌
- No record of purchase ❌
